# **App Name**: DataWise AI

## Core Features:

- Data Diagnosis: Provides a 'health report' of the dataset, diagnosing issues like completeness, quality, bias, and distribution, and suggesting remediation steps.
- Intelligent Visualization: Generates a selection of informative visualizations, each accompanied by AI-generated textual observations and insights.
- ML Model Suggestion: ML Model Recommendation Tool: Based on dataset characteristics and the diagnosed problem type, the AI intelligently suggests suitable machine learning tasks and model families. The LLM uses a tool to decide which model families to include in the recommendation.
- Data Profiling: Interactive and sortable tables with dataset profiling information.
- Interactive Report: Compile all findings into a structured, engaging, and customizable report.
- Dataset Upload: Allow users to upload their raw dataset into the application.
- Seamless Kaggle Data Import: Allow users to directly input a Kaggle dataset URL or competition ID. The DataPathfinder AI would then handle API authentication (if needed) and directly pull the data, including associated metadata (data descriptions, discussion topics, code notebooks).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust and intelligence.
- Background color: Light blue (#E7F5F9) to maintain a clean and professional appearance.
- Accent color: Purple (#A265C9) to draw attention to interactive elements.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability and a modern look.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a contemporary feel.
- Use simple, modern icons to represent different data characteristics and insights.
- Clean and intuitive layout to make it easy to upload datasets and view analysis.
